## JAVASCRIPT ADDRESS BOOK LAB PART 2 - DOM

Task: Create a new project that implements a front-end for your Address Book.

What does the application do?

2. Allow the user to add contacts by filling out a form.
3. Allow users to remove a contact by clicking a button.
Build Specifications:

3. Add a display method to the AddressBook. This method must update the DOM to
display all the contacts from the AddressBook.
4. Call display when the page first loads to show the contacts.
5. Create a delete button next to each contact, clicking this button will call the deleteAt
method on the AddressBook and then call display to update the DOM.

AddressBook and then call display to update the DOM.
